## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first design
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript
- Scss
- Prepros


### What I learned

I learned how to dynamically load HTML content from a data.json file. I was able to create conditionals to read the screen size to select a different key:value pair in the .json to output a different image. 
### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn best practices for responsiveness so the layout is consistent across various mobile, tablet, and desktop styles.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - This resource was helpful for JavaScript syntax.
- [GEEKS FOR GEEKS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/) - This site has a large library of JavaScript articles with code snipets that helped me with how to fetch and parse .json data. 
- [Techstacker] (https://techstacker.com/javascript-detect-if-screen-width-is-greater-or-less-than/) - this article was helpful in creating a listener for changes in the screen size to trigger a change in which image should be used in the mobile and tablet layout vs. the desktop layout.
